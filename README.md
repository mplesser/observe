# observe

*observe* is an *azcam* extension for running observing scripts. It can be used
with a Qt-based GUI or with a command line interface. The Qt GUI uses the *PySide2* package.

## Installation

`pip install azam-observe`

Or download from github: https://github.com/mplesser/azcam-observe.git.

## observe command

The *observe* command is usually executed from an console window. 

**Usage**:

   `observe.start()` to start the GUI.  A new window will open.

   GUI example after loading script file.
   
   After starting the GUI, Press "Select Script" to find a script to load on disk. 
   Then press "Load Script" to populate the table.  The excute, press Run.
   You may Pause a script after the current command by pressing the Pause/Resume button. 
   Then press the same button to resume the script.  The "Abort Script" button will 
   abort the script as soon as possible.
   
   If you have troubles, close the blue AzCamConsole window and start again.
   
**GUI Real-time Updates**:

   You may change a cell in the table to update values while a script is running.  Click in the cell, make the change and press "Enter" (or click elsewhere).
   
**Non-GUI Use**:

   It is still possible to run *observe* wihtout the GUI, although this mode is depricated.  See the autogenerated documentation for help.
   
**Examples**:

   `observe.observe('/azcam/systems/90prime/ObservingScripts/bass.txt',1)`\
   `observe.move_telescope_during_readout=1`

**Parameters**:

   Parameters (listed at the end of the documentation below) may be changed from the command line as:
   
   `observe.move_telescope_during_readout=1`\
   `observe.verbose=1`

**Script Commands**:

    Always use double quotes (") when needed
    Comment lines start with # or !
    Status integers are start of a script line are ignored or incremented
